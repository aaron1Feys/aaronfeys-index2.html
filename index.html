  <h2 id="html">HTML and CSS</h2>
  <p class="Standard_Text">An HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) document is a text file that tells the
browser (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, and others) how to assemble a
webpage. It says to the browser, “Put this heading here. Put that paragraph there. Insert
this picture here. Put that table there. Though it can create webpages with formatting that is sometimes elaborate and even
beautiful, an HTML document itself is pure text, without any formatting whatsoever. This
means you can’t use a word processing program like Microsoft Word to write HTML,
because Word and other word processors add formatting. Instead, you’ll choose from any
number of editing programs that produce pure text. The simplest of these is Notepad on a
PC and TextEdit, in Plain Text mode, on a Mac. You can also use fancier editing
programs. And there are web development tools like Dreamweaver. They all create the
pure text required for HTML. My favorite code editor is the open source Brackets, free at
http://brackets.io/.
When I ask you to do something in Brackets, Notepad, or TextEdit, feel free to
substitute any of the alternative editors.
Each HTML document creates a single webpage in the browser. If a site has a
hundred pages, it has a hundred HTML documents.
An HTML document’s name ends with the .html extension, as in about.html or
products.html.
When you’re looking at a webpage, you can see the name of the page’s HTML
document in the browser’s address bar.
http://www.ASmarterWayToLearn.com/htmlcss/23.html
When the line of characters shown above is entered in the browser’s address bar, the
browser loads the HTML document 23.html, and that page is assembled in the browser
and displayed on the user’s screen. If a user clicks a link on the page for, say
help.html, then the file help.html loads, and that page is displayed.
There’s one HTML name you usually won’t see in the browser’s address bar,
index.html. That’s the name of the page that loads by default when no HTML
document is specified. It’s the site’s home page. So if you enter this in the browser’s
address bar...
http://www.asmarterwaytolearn.com
...the document that loads (with some exceptions) is index.html.
All the HTML documents for a site are stored on the web hosts’s server, or, in the
case of a big, important site, often on the site owner’s own server. When the browser ispointed to a page on the site, the browser fetches the appropriate HTML file from the
server and displays that page.”</p>

  <h3 class="html">tags:</h3>

    <p class="Standard_Text">
      Tags are the commonest feature of an HTML document. You use them for all kinds
of things. Look at the 9 lines of HTML above. There are tags on every line. Usually—but
not always—HTML tags come in pairs, an opening tag paired with a closing tag. The
opening tag consists of some characters enclosed by and >. For example, . The
closing tag is the same as the opening tag, except a / follows the opening <. For example,
.
The opening tag tells the browser, “Begin here.” The closing tag tells the browser,
“End here.” So, for example, if you write...
These directions are important. Read them carefully.
...you’re telling the browser to begin the paragraph at “These” and to end it at
“carefully.”
The browser doesn’t care whether you put separate paragraphs on separate lines. As Imentioned above, it ignores carriage returns. But it’s conventional to break paragraphs in
your code.
    </p>

  <h3 class="html">paragraphs:</h3>
  <p class="Standard_Text">
    A paragraph tag is a tag that starts with &lt;p&gt; and ends always with &lt;/p&gt; You can use it for
    for writing a lot of text. It's the most basic element and has an importance of 0. The text that you are
    reading right now is also a pragraph. Maybe funny to note, the &lt; and &pg; are not actualy written
    like you see them. Its written like & p g ; and & l t ;.

  </p>

<h3 class="html"> headings: </h3>
<p class="Standard_Text">
  A heading on a webpage serves the same purpose as a heading in a newspaper or
magazine. It shows the user what’s important and gives her a sense of what the paragraphs
underneath it are about. Headings also help search engines understand a page.
HTML gives you six sizes of headings to choose from, h1 through h6. h1 is the
largest, h6 is the smallest.
You don’t have to include all the different sizes of headings in your HTML
document, but you should include an h1 heading, because search engines look for it. You
can have as many h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 headings in your document as you want, but
you should have only one h1 heading. Otherwise, search engines might get confused.
This is how you code the largest heading.
This is the largest heading.
Notice that there’s both an opening and a closing tag.

  <h3 class="css"> specifying fonts: </h3>
  <p class="smcss">
    Notice that it’s font-family, followed by a colon and a space. The list of fourfonts that follow is known as a font stack. If you’re specifying a font other than the generic
  serif, sans-serif, etc., you need to give the browser one or more fallback fonts. (If you’re
  unclear about the difference between serif and sans-serif fonts, Google it.) Fallback fonts
  are necessary because the browser grabs the fonts for the webpage from the user’s
  computer. If your first font choice isn’t installed on the computer, the browser moves on to
  your second-choice font, then your third-choice font, etc. The stack can list as many fonts
  as you like, but the common practice is to list three or four. The last fallback—the last font
  in the stack—is always the generic, for example sans-serif, to guarantee that the browser
  will be able to display something in the family if none of your other choices is found. If a
  font name has any spaces in it, enclose it in quotation marks, as in “Times New
  Roman”. The specification ends with a semicolon.
    </p>

  <h3 class="css">linking your CSS to your HTML:</h3>
  <p class="smcss">
    This is a mouthful, so let’s break it down.
First, notice that the link information goes between the head and /head tags,
rather than between the body and /body tags, where you wrote your two
paragraphs. The difference between the head and body sections is that the head section
deals with a few technical matters—like telling the browser where to find the CSS file—
while the body section contains the content of the page.
Next, notice that the link information itself is a tag. It’s placed inside an opening. But unlike all the other tags you see in the code above, it isn’t paired with
a closing tag. It stands alone.
The link tag consists of three “equations:” Each equation says that something equals
something else. The second something is in quotation marks.
1st “equation”: link rel=“stylesheet” tells the browser that the link
relationship is with a stylesheet.
2nd “equation”: This is a useless, vestigial part of the tag, like your appendix. We’ve
already told the browser the link is to a stylesheet. All stylesheets end with the extension
“css,” and they’re all text documents, so this just repeats what the browser should already
know. But we still have to include it (but maybe not for long).
3rd “equation”: href stands for hypertext reference. This part of the tag tells the
browser where to find the CSS file to link to. We’ve put it in the css subfolder of the
folder where this HTML document resides, the my-smarter-site folder. The file
name is “styles.css.”
Something to notice about formatting here: There are no spaces in the tag, exceptthose separating the three “equations.”
Enter the link tag in your practice.html document. Save it, and have your
browser display the webpage it creates. Expect the paragraphs to be in a serif font and the
heading in a sans-serif font, as you specified in the CSS file. Find sample HTML code at:
</p>

<h3 class="css"> CSS classes: </h3>
<p class="smcss">
  Save your CSS file. Now you’ve created special styling for a class of paragraphs.
This special style named “important” will override the general style that you created
earlier. When you say you want text in paragraphs of the class “important” to have a font-
size of 1.5em, you’re saying you want the text to be one-and-a-half times normal size.
But what is normal size? It depends on whether you’ve created a general style in your CSS
file that applies to the whole page (See Chapter 19). If you haven’t created a general
paragraph style, normal size is the browser default size—1em. So then a 1.5em font-size
for the paragraph class “important” would be one-and-a-half times the browser default
size. The rules for naming classes would fill a book. To keep things simple, I’m going to
ask you to use lowercase alphabet letters, hyphens, underlines, and numbers. But don’t
start a name with a number. Here’s an example of a class for h3 headings.
</p>

<h3 class="css"> classes not tied to an element: </h3>
  <p class="smcss">
    You’ve created a new style named “typewriter” that will style text in a typewriter
font. It could be paragraph text. It could be heading text. It could be other kinds of text
elements that I’ll introduce you to later.
Notice that there’s no element name, like p or h3, involved here. It’s just a dot with
the class name following it. Save the file.
